BioPetals
---------

Recipe_BioPetals.json

It's always bothered me that you can't turn flower petals into biomass. It's possible
to run your car on paint made from those petals, you can burn them as-is, but you can't
process them into the much more efficient biomass.

Problem solved! Now you can craft petals into biomass the same way as everything else.
Megajoule for megajoule, petals are as efficient as leaves (gaining 6:1), and worse than
everything else.

This recipe is unlocked by researching flower petals in the MAM.

BioMixture
----------

Recipe_BioMixture.json

The true advantage of biomass is that it's a mixture of everything, carefully balanced
for flammability. At the cost of complexity, you can now optimize your use of leaves and
petals, producing notable quantities of biomass from them. The return on investment is
18:1, better than wood (9:1) but still a far cry from using the local wildlife (72:1 for
carapaces, 144:1 for organs).

Requires the use of an Assembler and cannot be cut by hand.

This recipe is also unlocked by researching flower petals in the MAM.
